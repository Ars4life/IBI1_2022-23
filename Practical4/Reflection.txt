Practical4 is quit difficult compare to the previous practical. but after the task, i gradually understand how does git and github work.

It is really frustrated when I couldn't push my changes onto github. It always return a fatal. But after searching, i got that the password was not to my account, but a token of the github. This waste me a lot of time.

I also understand the importance of a good commit words, because it can tell each time what kinds of changes you have made, and you can go back to the previous version esier.

It's fun to make my own web page, but it is rough.

I use to thought the lesson before we start pythong is easy and boring, but this Practical told me i was wroung, it takes effort to finish all the work well and comprehend how and why it work.

and lastly i hope i won't get stuck like this time in the future.
