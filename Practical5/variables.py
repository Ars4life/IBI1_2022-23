# create the variable 'a' & 'b' & 'c' represent the location of Edingburgh & Los Angeles & Haining
a = -3.19
b = -118.24
c = 116.39

# Calculate the distence between Edingburg to Los Angle represented by 'd', and Edingburg to Haining. i will take the direction to east as the postive.
d = a - b
e = c - a

# Compare the distance 'd' & 'e' by print b > e, if return True, d is greater, else e is greater.
print(d > e)

# the result is 'False', which means the longtitude form Edingburg to Haining is greater.

# Use the variables 'X' & 'Y' to store True & False

W = X and Y
